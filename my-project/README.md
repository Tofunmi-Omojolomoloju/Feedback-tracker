# React Feedback Tracker

## Project Overview
This is a simple React app that tracks feedback from users with three options: Like, Dislike, and Love. The app displays feedback counts and shows which feedback was submitted most recently.

## Learning Outcomes Covered

- *Virtual DOM*: React updates the UI efficiently when the state changes.
- *State*: Used Reactâ€™s useState hook to manage feedback counts and the current feedback.
- *JSX*: Built the user interface using JSX syntax.
- *Functional Components*: The entire app is created using functional React components.
- *Event Handlers*: Handled button clicks to update feedback counts and current feedback.
- *React Fragments*: Used fragments (<>...</>) to group elements without extra markup.
- *Basic Styling*: Applied CSS to layout the components and style the buttons and display.

## Features
- Three feedback options: Like, Dislike, and Love.
- Feedback counts update in real time when buttons are clicked.
